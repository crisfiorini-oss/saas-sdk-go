//
// after is an opaque position the host gave, exclusive; JournalStart or the empty
// string reads from the oldest retained entry. limit is 1..500, and zero means the host's
// default. types must name at least one registered type. deliveryBindings are
// the caller's binding ids whose mints and exchanges count as delivery
// machinery: the host sets JournalEntry.DeliveryMachinery on the entries that
// record one of them, and may be empty for a reader that has none. A read
// changes nothing on the host: it is safe to repeat, and a reader that resumes
// from an earlier NextAfter is served the same entries again. A rejected module
// capability is refreshed and retried once, like every authority call.
