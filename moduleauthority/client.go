// Package moduleauthority exchanges a composed module's installed authority
// with the SaaS host, through a broker and an explicitly selected authority
// transport:
//
//   - the gateway's module broker (REST, JSON over HTTP on the gateway base
//     URL) — where a module presents its pod's projected ServiceAccount token
//     and is minted a Work Context: POST /modules/_work-context,
//     /modules/_operation-context and
//     /modules/_source-operation-context. The Mint* RPCs of
//     ModuleCapabilitiesService are EXPOSURE_INTERNAL and are never served at
//     the gateway edge; the broker is how a module reaches them.
//   - accounts' named `authority` gRPC endpoint — where a module calls, with
//     its module Work Context, the procedures the host exports to composed
//     modules (ExchangeDelegatedOperationAudience among them). New selects this
//     transport. NewGatewayAuthority instead uses the host gateway bridge for
//     procedures that the selected host exposes there, without direct fallback.
//
// Neither address is configured here: the consumer passes what Codefly
// resolved for it, in Seams.
