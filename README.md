# saas-sdk-go

The **Go SDK for the saas accounts API** — a versioned, published client that
solutions depend on instead of regenerating and vendoring their own `gen/` tree.

The SDK surfaces are:

- **`gen/`** — the generated Connect + protobuf bindings for the accounts public
  proto (`saas.accounts.v1` and friends), generated from
  `codefly-dev/module-saas-starter` at the ref recorded below.
- **`accounts/`** — a thin, gateway-bound facade with syntactic sugar over the
  generated stubs. It hides the `connect.Request/Response` envelope and the raw
  procedure strings, so a solution handler writes plain protos:

  ```go
  resp, err := accounts.New(gw).Audit().QueryAuditLog(ctx, &accounts.QueryAuditLogRequest{PageSize: 20})
  ```

  `gw` is any value exposing `BaseURL() string` and `HTTPClient() *http.Client` —
  which `github.com/codefly-dev/solution-runtime-go.Gateway` already satisfies.
  The runtime stays accounts-agnostic and takes **no** dependency on this SDK.

  `Datasources()` is the same facade over `DatasourceService`: the host's
  source connection, operation and account-link contract, message for message.
  It covers `ListSources`, `GetSource`, `AddSource`, `ListSourceOperations`,
  `DeclareSourceOperations`, `InvokeSourceOperation`,
  `LookupInvokeSourceOperation`, `BeginDatasourceAccountLink`,
  `CompleteDatasourceAccountLink` and `ListMyDatasourceAccountLinks`, and
  every message, enum, enum value and oneof wrapper they reach is re-exported
  from `accounts` under its generated name:

  ```go
  added, err := accounts.New(gw).Datasources().AddSource(ctx, &accounts.AddSourceRequest{
      OrgId:    org,
      Provider: accounts.DatasourceProvider_DATASOURCE_PROVIDER_API,
      Config: &accounts.AddSourceRequest_Api{Api: &accounts.ApiDatasourceConfig{
          BaseUrl:        "https://api.example.com",
          CredentialKind: accounts.ApiCredentialKind_API_CREDENTIAL_KIND_OAUTH2,
          Oauth2: &accounts.ApiOAuth2Config{
              Grant:    accounts.ApiOAuth2Config_GRANT_AUTHORIZATION_CODE,
              TokenUrl: "https://api.example.com/oauth/token",
              ClientId: clientID,
          },
      }},
      Boundary:   &accounts.AddSourceRequest_CollectionLabel{CollectionLabel: "invoices"},
      Credential: clientSecret,
  })
  ```

  It is the raw contract: a refusal is the host's Connect error, code,
  message and `ErrorInfo` intact. `datasource/` below is the ergonomic layer
  over the same service, and its `Invoke` and `Lookup` are the effect-safe way
  to call an operation: they mint the effect ID, keep it on every outcome and
  classify an unknown one. `InvokeSourceOperation` sends exactly the request it
  is given. Both facades read responses through the same client.
- **`datasource/`** — the same facade over `DatasourceService`, so a solution
  connects a GitHub datasource collection in a few lines:

  ```go
  ds := datasource.New(gw)
  src, err := ds.AddGitHubSource(ctx, datasource.GitHubSource{
      OrgID:       org,
      Repo:        "codefly-dev/module-saas-starter",
      Paths:       []string{"docs"},
      Collection:  "handbook",
      FileExtensions: []string{".md"},
      AccessToken: token,
  })
  _, err = ds.Sync(ctx, org, src.GetId())
  ```

  The **call** half uses that same gateway and client to invoke a declared
  operation of a connected API as the signed-in person:

  ```go
  result, err := ds.Invoke(ctx, orgID, sourceID, "list_invoices",
      map[string]any{"limit": 20}, datasource.WithDeadline(time.Now().Add(10*time.Second)))
  if errors.Is(err, datasource.ErrOutcomeUnknown) {
      // Preserve result.Receipt.EffectID. Use Lookup with a live context;
      // an unknown outcome does not mean the effect failed.
      return err
  }
  if err != nil {
      return err
  }
  output := result.Output // json.RawMessage
  receipt := result.Receipt
  ```

  `Invoke` marshals a JSON object (a map, struct with JSON tags, or
  `json.RawMessage`) to the host's `input_json` string. The response's
  `output_json` is validated as one JSON object and returned as
  `json.RawMessage`, preserving its number precision and text. Invocation
  payloads never pass through protobuf `Struct`; declaration schemas still
  use the host's `Struct` fields. `WithDeadline(time.Time)` bounds
  only this call; an earlier context deadline still wins. `WithEffectID(id)`
  supplies an effect ID of 1–128 UTF-8 bytes without control bytes or surrounding
  spaces (which HTTP would trim); interior spaces and Unicode are supported;
  when omitted, the SDK mints a UUIDv7. Invalid IDs return `*InputError` before
  dispatch. A deadline already expired before dispatch (including an earlier
  parent deadline) returns `*InputError` with no `Result` and zero RPC calls.
  An explicitly canceled context returns `context.Canceled` with no result.
  Once a call is attempted, even an error
  returns a non-nil `Result` containing that
  ID in `Receipt.EffectID`. Persist a caller-owned ID **before** invoking a
  mutation if it must survive a process crash.

  Repeating the same effect ID and **byte-identical `input_json`** asks the
  **host** to replay its receipt. Persist the encoded input with the ID and
  reuse it as `json.RawMessage`: rebuilding an equivalent object with a
  different field order can be refused. Every valid explicit
  `Invoke` reaches the host: the SDK has no retry loop, deduplication or
  receipt cache. Do not change the ID to recover an uncertain mutation.

  `Lookup(ctx, orgID, sourceID, effectID)` returns the receipt and its committed
  `Output` without invoking the provider. The shared SDK signature keeps `orgID` and
  `sourceID`, but the wire request sends **only `effect_id`**: the host derives
  the tenant from the gateway's Work Context and recovers the source from the
  stored effect binding. These two arguments cannot select or override lookup
  authority. A lookup miss returns `ErrEffectNotFound` and a receipt carrying
  the same ID with status `NOT_ATTEMPTED`; an explicit reinvoke with that ID is
  safe, and the SDK never invokes automatically. NotFound means the host has
  no attempt marker. Once an attempt exists, Lookup recovers the saved receipt
  independently of the current declaration: committed receipts survive its
  removal or replacement, and unresolved or expired receipts remain unknown.
  The caller's current source read authority still applies; revoked access refuses.

  `Receipt.Output` always comes from the saved `receipt.output_json` evidence;
  `Result.Output` comes from the top-level `output_json`. Both fields must contain
  one JSON object on a committed response. If either is missing or malformed,
  `*DatasourceError` retains the COMMITTED receipt, effect ID, commit time and
  provider status (and any valid receipt output). Bad output does not erase a
  commit or authorize another effect. Missing/mismatched receipt identity,
  unsupported status or invalid commit time instead yields `ErrOutcomeUnknown`.
  An UNKNOWN receipt does not require valid output.

  Re-invoking a retained effect after its declaration is removed returns
  `*OperationDeclarationRemoved` (`errors.Is(err, ErrOperationDeclarationRemoved)`).
  Its `ReceiptStatus` and `Receipt.Status` carry the host's `receipt_status`:
  exact `committed` becomes `COMMITTED`; `unknown`, missing or unrecognized
  metadata becomes `UNKNOWN`. The outcome and `Result.Receipt` retain the
  original effect ID. This is distinct from a refusal and from `OutcomeUnknown`,
  even when its receipt status is unknown. No output, commit time or provider
  status is inferred from the error. **Recover with Lookup, never with a fresh ID.**
  A committed status here means the saved output must be retrieved through Lookup.

  An unknown receipt is returned alongside
  `ErrOutcomeUnknown`; check it with `errors.Is`. **Unknown is an outcome,
  not evidence of failure or permission to repeat an effect.** Invoke also
  reports transport loss or deadline expiry after dispatch conservatively as
  unknown, since it cannot prove the operation was read-only. Every non-Connect
  HTTP error after Invoke or Lookup dispatch, including 4xx, 429 and 500,
  likewise returns `ErrOutcomeUnknown` with the original ID. The Connect
  decoder identifies RPC errors; decoded errors retain their code/reason
  mappings. Check
  `errors.Is(err, datasource.ErrOutcomeUnknown)` and
  `errors.Is(err, datasource.ErrOperationDeclarationRemoved)` **before** transport-code
  retry logic: the wrapped Connect error remains available for diagnostics,
  but its code does not establish whether the effect happened. An unavailable
  lookup also returns an unknown receipt: it cannot establish what happened to the effect. Use a
  fresh bounded context to look up an effect after the original context has
  expired.

  For logging and metrics, `errors.As` can inspect both
  `*datasource.OutcomeUnknown` (including its receipt) and the wrapped
  `*connect.Error`; `errors.Is` also preserves an underlying context error.
  The SDK never retries either error.

  `DeclareOperations(ctx, orgID, sourceID, []datasource.Operation)` replaces
  the source's declaration set atomically under the host's administrator
  check. Both schemas must be supplied as JSON objects; omitted schemas return
  `InputError` before dispatch. Explicit `{}` is accepted for host admission.
  `ListOperations(ctx, orgID, sourceID)` reads the set and represents absent
  schemas as `{}`, so its operations can be re-declared. For example, an API
  connected to `https://example.com` could declare:

  ```go
  err := ds.DeclareOperations(ctx, orgID, sourceID, []datasource.Operation{{
      Name: "list_invoices", Method: "GET", Path: "/invoices", Query: []string{"limit"},
      Description: "List available invoices",
      Input: json.RawMessage(`{"type":"object","properties":{"limit":{"type":"integer"}},"additionalProperties":false}`),
      Output: json.RawMessage(`{"type":"object"}`),
      Effect: datasource.EffectReadOnly, MaxOutputBytes: 65536,
  }})
  ```

  `ListOperations` includes each operation's description and host-computed
  `Digest`; declarations ignore a caller-supplied digest. An absent or
  `EFFECT_UNSPECIFIED` host effect returns `*InputError` with an empty pointer
  and the message `host returned an unspecified effect`; an unknown future
  numeric effect returns `*DatasourceError` with no receipt. Neither returns
  a partial list. The host admits the
  schemas, route, effect and output cap. Invocation never
  accepts a provider URL or credential. The gateway's HTTP client carries
  the person's Work Context unchanged; this facade adds only
  `x-codefly-effect-id` to the normal Connect request, matching the request's
  effect ID. It never mints, replaces or sets a Work Context header.

  | Host response | Go result |
  | --- | --- |
  | PermissionDenied | `ErrNotPermitted` (`errors.Is`) |
  | Invoke NotFound | `ErrUnknownOperation` (`errors.Is`) |
  | Lookup NotFound | receipt plus `ErrEffectNotFound` (`errors.Is`); keep the ID for an explicit reinvoke |
  | InvalidArgument | `*InputError`, with `Pointer` from the first `BadRequest.FieldViolation.field` |
  | ResourceExhausted + DATASOURCE_RATE_LIMITED | `*RateLimited`, with `ResetAt` from `reset_at` or `RetryInfo` |
  | FailedPrecondition + SOURCE_OPERATION_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN | receipt plus `ErrOutcomeUnknown` (`errors.Is`); the mutation may have happened |
  | FailedPrecondition + SOURCE_OPERATION_DECLARATION_REMOVED | receipt plus `*OperationDeclarationRemoved` / `ErrOperationDeclarationRemoved`; recover the original ID with Lookup |
  | FailedPrecondition + SOURCE_PROVIDER_REFUSED | `*ProviderRefused`, with `Status` from `ErrorInfo.metadata["provider_status"]` when known |
  | FailedPrecondition + SOURCE_EFFECT_REUSED | `ErrEffectReused` (`errors.Is`) |
  | Other FailedPrecondition | `*OperationRefused`, with the structured `Reason` or an empty string |
  | Non-Connect HTTP error after Invoke/Lookup dispatch (4xx or 5xx) | receipt plus `ErrOutcomeUnknown`; retain the original ID |
  | Ambiguous Invoke / unknown receipt | receipt plus `ErrOutcomeUnknown` (`errors.Is`) |
  | Valid COMMITTED receipt with invalid output JSON | receipt plus `*DatasourceError`; commit evidence is retained |

  `SOURCE_OPERATION_OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` is an effect outcome only on Invoke and
  Lookup. On Declare/List it is `OperationRefused` carrying that reason.
  Null, unknown or undecodable protobuf error details are skipped; valid
  neighboring details still determine the outcome. For Declare/List,
  non-Connect HTTP 403 with a supported encoding maps to `ErrNotPermitted`
  through Connect's HTTP fallback;
  on Invoke/Lookup the same non-Connect response remains unknown.

  Connect JSON errors accept a case-insensitive UTF-8 charset parameter,
  case-insensitive gzip encoding and a leading UTF-8 BOM. A response adapter
  normalizes those encodings before Connect decodes the envelope; it forwards
  the request unchanged through the gateway's existing HTTP client. Empty,
  identity and gzip encodings are accepted case-insensitively. Unsupported
  encodings such as `br` are rejected before reading the body or inferring an
  HTTP status: Declare/List return `*DatasourceError` with no receipt, while
  Invoke/Lookup return `ErrOutcomeUnknown` with the original effect ID. The
  diagnostic cause is retained and no retry occurs. Other charsets and media
  types remain non-Connect. Timestamp strings follow the
  protobuf JSON profile (years 0001–9999, at most nine fractional digits).

  The recorded host ref emits structured input pointers and provider HTTP
  statuses. `InputError.Pointer` is empty when no field violation is supplied;
  otherwise the JSON Pointer is preserved verbatim. `ProviderRefused.Status`
  is zero when metadata is missing or is not a three-digit ASCII decimal HTTP
  status from 100–599. Status metadata is read only for `SOURCE_PROVIDER_REFUSED`;
  it cannot turn an unknown outcome into a provider refusal.
  The host's receipt guard also emits detail-free precondition refusals, represented
  as `OperationRefused` with an empty reason. A precondition refusal does not
  establish the outcome of an earlier attempt under that ID.

  Other errors retain their Connect identity. Host diagnostic messages are
  preserved, including credential-looking text: **the host is the disclosure
  guard**. The SDK neither redacts messages nor treats their prose as status
  metadata. These names mirror the Python facade's `invoke`, `lookup`,
  `declare_operations`, `list_operations`, `Operation`, `Result`, `Receipt`,
  `NotPermitted`, `UnknownOperation`, `EffectNotFound`, `EffectReused`,
  `DatasourceError`, `InputError`, `RateLimited`, `ProviderRefused`, `OperationRefused`, `OperationDeclarationRemoved` and
  `OutcomeUnknown`.

  This call surface uses the four host RPCs from
  [module-saas-starter#1052](https://github.com/codefly-dev/module-saas-starter/pull/1052).
  `SOURCE.txt` records the released host tag `v0.0.103` used to regenerate
  the bindings. This regeneration does not publish an SDK release.
  The host's runtime-scheduled `PruneSourceOperationReceipts` and
  `LookupPruneSourceOperationReceipts` are included in the generated bindings
  only; this caller facade does not expose receipt retention operations.
- **`moduleauthority/`** — the module-principal side of installed operation
  authority. A long-running module supplies a source for its pod's projected
  ServiceAccount token; the client rereads it before every mint and refreshes
  the module's short-lived Work Context, attaches it to the generic SaaS
  exchange, and returns the exchanged
  child as an opaque `string`. The signed-in person's retained parent and
  the exchanged child remain request-local.

  Every Work Context this package carries — the module's own, an operation or
  source context, the exchanged child, a `Parent` handed in — is an opaque
  string in core's encoding. The client is its holder and sender, never its
  verifier: before caching or sending one it asks only
  `github.com/codefly-dev/core/workcontext.Decode` whether it is structurally a
  sealed capability, and attaches it under core's `wool.WorkContextHeader`. A
  mint answering anything else (the pre-cutover JSON payload among them) is
  `ErrInvalidCapability`; a `Parent` core does not decode is refused as invalid
  input (`ErrInvalidExchange`, `ErrInvalidArtifact`, `ErrInvalidInstallation`)
  before anything is sent. **This needs a host whose accounts mints core-format
  Work Contexts** (module-saas-starter#1093); the former v0.0.94 source mints
  the pre-cutover format, which this client refuses. `SOURCE.txt` now records
  v0.0.103.

  `Client.ModuleWorkContext(ctx)` returns a cached token, sharing refreshes
  between concurrent callers. Consumers that already own their expiry and
  refresh controller use `Client.MintModuleWorkContext(ctx)` instead:

  ```go
  issued, err := authority.MintModuleWorkContext(ctx)
  if err != nil {
      return err
  }
  // issued.Token is opaque; issued.ExpiresAt is the broker's reported expiry.
  ```

  This returns `ModuleContext{Token string, ExpiresAt time.Time}` and mints
  once per call. It neither reads nor updates the cached token, coalesces
  concurrent calls, nor retries failures. Both methods use the same broker
  request, bounded response reader, expiry parser and refusal mapping. The
  projected credential is reread for each mint; the organization remains the
  client's `Credentials.OrganizationID`, so keep a client per organization.
  The returned expiry comes from the broker, never from decoded token claims.
  It does not prove authority or override a verifier's lifetime limit; Core
  owns authority validation, and consumers own their refresh/deadline policy.

  It talks to the two seams the host serves a composed module, and takes both
  explicitly — the consumer passes what Codefly resolved, nothing is defaulted:

  - the **gateway's module broker** (HTTP on the auth-gateway's `workload`
    endpoint, API `http`): `POST /modules/_work-context`, `/modules/_operation-context`
    and `/modules/_source-operation-context`, where the module presents its
    pod's projected ServiceAccount token (audience `accounts`) as the bearer;
    the host reviews it and mints only for the principal's declared workload
    running the build its authority approves. The host never serves the `Mint*` procedures of
    `ModuleCapabilitiesService` at the gateway edge;
  - accounts' **`authority` gRPC endpoint** (`saas/accounts/authority`), where
    the module calls, with its module Work Context, the procedures the host
    exports to composed modules (`ExchangeDelegatedOperationAudience`).

  ```go
  authority, err := moduleauthority.New(moduleauthority.Seams{
      Gateway:       workloadGateway,                      // resolved workload endpoint + HTTPClient()
      Authority:     moduleauthority.Authority{Address: authorityHostPort}, // TLS: nil = h2c
      InternalToken: internalToken,
      // Only from the consumer's own configured assertion that every
      // in-cluster hop is carried by a mutually authenticated mesh.
      AllowInsecureHTTP: meshProtected,
  }, moduleauthority.Credentials{
      Prefix: modulePrefix,
      // Read before every mint: the kubelet rotates the projection.
      Token: moduleauthority.WorkloadTokenFile(),
      // Required for a shared module; a tenant-pinned module may omit it.
      OrganizationID: organizationID,
  })
  if err != nil {
      return err // ErrInvalidSeams / ErrInvalidCredentials: fail closed at startup
  }
  defer authority.Close()
  child, err := authority.ExchangeOperation(ctx, moduleauthority.ExchangeRequest{
      BindingID: installedBindingID,
      Parent:    retainedParent,
      Lookup:    false,
  })
  ```

  `New` refuses a missing internal token, gateway base URL or an incomplete
  authority seam. Leaving `Authority` zero builds a mint-only client; authority
  calls then return `ErrNoAuthority`. It refuses to send the internal token or
  the projected token in plaintext to anything but `localhost` or a loopback IP unless
  `AllowInsecureHTTP` asserts the hop is mesh-protected. SaaS owns the installed
  binding's audience, scopes, lifetime, verification, and audit record.

  `WorkloadTokenFile()` is where Codefly projected the token for a
  module-identity service: the file `CODEFLY__WORKLOAD_TOKEN_FILE` names when
  that is set, and the pod mount, `/var/run/secrets/codefly/token`, otherwise.
  A native `codefly run` (CLI v0.1.187 and later) stands in for the cell and
  projects each such service's token to a file of its own, since a process
  cannot read the pod mount, but it sets that variable only for a service that
  declares `module-identity` and does **not** declare `workload-identity`. A
  `workload-identity` service gets its token's path as `TOKEN_FILE` in its
  `workload-identity` configuration instead, so for it the helper falls back
  to the pod path, which does not exist under a native run; it passes
  `ProjectedTokenFile(path)` with that configured path. A consumer with any
  other projection does the same; `ProjectedTokenFile` has no default. The host requires audience
  `accounts` and a token lifetime of at most 600 seconds, and verifies the pod,
  workload and approved build. The SDK rereads the source for every actual mint
  (including a module Work Context refresh), trims whitespace, and rejects an
  empty token or one larger than 64 KiB with `ErrInvalidCredentials` before
  sending. `ProjectedTokenFile` also bounds the file read to 64 KiB. Every mint
  sends exactly one `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header alongside the
  internal perimeter token; the removed module-secret credential has no fallback.
  Since host v0.0.103 the gateway serves the three mints on its workload
  endpoint alone and holds the internal token on the two operation mints only:
  the work-context mint's perimeter is that endpoint, and its credential the
  projected token. `Seams.Gateway` names that endpoint.

  The REST bodies match [the v0.0.103 gateway](https://github.com/codefly-dev/module-saas-starter/blob/v0.0.103/module/services/auth-gateway/code/gateway_modules.go):

  | Mint path | JSON fields sent |
  | --- | --- |
  | `/modules/_work-context` | `prefix`, optional `organization_id` |
  | `/modules/_operation-context` | `prefix`, `binding`, optional `organization_id` |
  | `/modules/_source-operation-context` | `prefix`, `source_id` |

  Set `Credentials.OrganizationID` for a shared module and use a separate client
  per organization, since each client caches its own module Work Context. A
  tenant-pinned module may omit the selector or name its own tenant. The host
  checks the module envelope and live installation; selecting an organization
  grants no authority. The selector must be a canonical UUID (lowercase,
  hyphenated), as accounts requires; `New` refuses any other form with
  `ErrInvalidCredentials` at construction, whichever mints the client will
  make, rather than letting the first work or operation mint fail as an
  untyped 400. A client that only mints source operation contexts leaves it
  empty. A missing or wrong organization — a shared module that names none, or a
  tenant-pinned module that names another — is refused as unproven
  credentials: `ErrInvalidCredentials` (HTTP 401) from `ModuleWorkContext`, and
  `ErrPermissionDenied` (HTTP 403) from `MintModuleOperationContext`. The host
  does not say that the organization was the cause. Source mints ignore this selector and derive their
  organization from the source's delegation. Deployment and identity requirements
  are in [MODULE_INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/codefly-dev/module-saas-starter/blob/v0.0.94/module/MODULE_INSTALLATION.md)
  and [Establishing what a caller is running](https://github.com/codefly-dev/module-saas-starter/blob/v0.0.94/module/services/accounts/AGENTS.md#establishing-what-a-caller-is-running).

  `ExchangeRequest` presents authority one of two ways, and exactly one — both,
  or neither, is `ErrInvalidExchange` before anything is sent. `Parent` is a live
  capability the caller holds, as the encoded string it arrived as; the child is attenuated against it and expires
  with it, so **work that outlives the parent cannot be authorized this way at
  all**. `DelegationID` is a reference to a host-owned, revocable source
  delegation, as `MintSourceOperationContext` reported it:

  ```go
  child, err := authority.ExchangeOperation(ctx, moduleauthority.ExchangeRequest{
      BindingID:    installedBindingID,
      DelegationID: delegationID, // no parent, and none needs to still be valid
  })
  ```

  No capability is presented on that arm and none is held. The host re-checks
  that the delegation is live, the source exists, the person still holds the
  role and the binding is unchanged, then mints that call's child. So it is not
  bounded by any token's remaining life and may be called again *after* the
  previous child has expired — which is the whole of the renewal path for work
  longer than a Work Context. A revocation takes effect on the next exchange.
  The reference is an identifier, never a credential: on its own it authorizes
  nothing, and the caller's own module Work Context still authenticates the call.

  Background work with no person present mints its own operation context
  instead. It carries exactly the binding's `headless_scopes`; a binding that
  declares none is refused with `ErrPermissionDenied`. It lives about a minute
  and is never cached, so mint one per call or short batch:

  ```go
  op, err := authority.MintModuleOperationContext(ctx, installedBindingID)
  // op.Token goes in x-codefly-work-context on the call to op.Audience.
  ```
  `EmitAuditEvent(ctx, AuditEvent)` sends a registered event through the same
  module-authenticated authority seam. The host checks the module's grant,
  tenant, actor, solution and registered field schema. The event's actor may be
  the module's own principal or a `system:<process>` label; a subject actor must
  belong to the tenant. An empty tenant requires the host's cross-tenant grant.

  ```go
  // Persist the complete event and key in the producer's outbox before sending.
  event := moduleauthority.AuditEvent{
      Tenant: tenantID, EventType: "example.changed", Actor: "system:worker",
      Solution: "example", EntryID: entryID, IdempotencyKey: outboxEventID,
      Fields: map[string]any{"count": float64(3)},
  }
  if err := authority.EmitAuditEvent(ctx, event); err != nil {
      return err // Keep the outbox entry and its original key for recovery.
  }
  // The host acknowledged the event; the producer may now settle its outbox row.
  ```

  The host deduplicates by `(tenant, event_type, idempotency_key)`. Persist and
  reuse the **complete original event and key** across retries and restarts;
  never reuse a key for another intent. The contract in `SOURCE.txt` acknowledges
  a duplicate key without comparing its payload. An empty key disables
  deduplication, and some registered types require a key. Field values use the
  protobuf Struct representation, so numbers are represented as doubles.

  A nil error acknowledges the host's durable audit write or an existing key,
  not completion of outbound webhook delivery. After a timeout or transport
  error the write may already have committed. The SDK does not own an outbox,
  store receipts, or automatically retry an uncertain effect; only rejected
  module authentication is refreshed and retried once. Host error codes remain
  available through `connect.CodeOf(err)`. Receipt lookup and runtime-boundary
  attestation await an integrated host contract and are not exposed here.

- **`settings/`** — the schema-agnostic typed-settings library every module and
  product depends on instead of vendoring a copy. It has two parts:

  - **runtime** (`settings`) — presence-aware `Field[M, T]` access over a
    generated protobuf settings message, plus a `JSONCodec` that is the only
    boundary between typed settings and their sparse ProtoJSON storage. Product
    code works with typed fields and never traverses protobuf parents or JSON
    keys. `usersettings` below is the product's own generated field catalog (not
    shipped by this SDK); it is built once on top of these `settings.Field`
    helpers:

    ```go
    theme, err := usersettings.Fields.Appearance.Theme.Get(document)   // default when absent
    err = usersettings.Fields.Email.Product.Set(document, false)        // explicit false stays present
    ```

  - **renderers** (`settings/catalog`) — the reusable half of `module-compose`.
    A module declares its settings contributions and gets Go / TypeScript /
    proto catalogs from `catalog.RenderGo` / `RenderTypeScript` / `RenderProto`,
    instead of re-implementing the render functions in-repo.

  The runtime imports no generated schema, so it is byte-for-byte reusable
  across products; product-specific fields belong in the product proto and its
  typed field catalog, never here.

- **Verifying a Work Context you receive is not this SDK's job.** The callee
  side lives in `github.com/codefly-dev/sdk-go/workcontext`, which re-exports
  core's verifier (`NewVerifier`, `HeaderName`, `FromHeaders`, the key-set
  helpers). The `workcontext/` package that used to live here — a JWKS verifier

## Versioning

This SDK's release version tracks the **saas-starter module version**
(`module/module.package.codefly.yaml`), recorded in `SOURCE.txt` alongside the
proto ref `gen/` was generated from.

## Regenerating `gen/`

The proto source of truth is `module-saas-starter/module/services/accounts/proto`.
To refresh from a released tag (in a checkout of that repo):

```bash
git fetch origin tag v0.0.103
git checkout --detach v0.0.103
cd module/services/accounts/proto
buf generate --template <this-repo>/buf.gen.yaml -o <this-repo>
```

`buf.gen.yaml` sets `managed.override.go_package_prefix =
github.com/codefly-dev/saas-sdk-go/gen`, so the descriptors are generated with
the correct module path. **Never hand-edit `gen/` or sed the module path** — the
protobuf file descriptors embed length-prefixed package strings and a text
rewrite corrupts them (panics at `init()`). Always regenerate.

The template generates the complete host-owned `saas/` schema tree. Its
vendored `codefly/` import closure is compiled for Runnable annotations, with
imports resolved to `github.com/codefly-dev/core/generated/go`; Core owns
those Go descriptors. Emitting a second copy in this SDK would conflict at
protobuf initialization. The `host/` installation import similarly resolves to
`github.com/codefly-dev/authority/libraries/authority-client/go/gen`, the
existing owner of shared `ConsentApproval` bindings. The canonical Authority
client at `v0.0.0-20261026143932-67b85b14a942` requires Core
`v0.19.7-0.20261026092055-b23dc13543b2`; these development source pins are not
published release tags. Publishing the SDK requires compatible owner releases.
The dependency requires Go 1.27.3. Core v0.19.5 still requires
`SealSource.ApprovedBuild`, so it cannot build this SDK. Verify the compatible
dependency floor with SDK and consumer builds when refreshing it.
The generation plugin versions remain pinned.
Record the release tag in `SOURCE.txt`; CI checks out that tag through
`refs/tags/` and verifies that regeneration leaves no diff. Before a host
release, an exact PR-head commit may be used for development. The same ref is
the host whose real auth-gateway handlers `moduleauthority` must mint through
in CI (`conformance/hostgateway/run.sh <host checkout>`), so moving it moves
the broker contract too.

Regeneration and matching SDK releases are owned by `module-saas-starter` and
this repository. Until release automation covers both, follow the
`refresh-generated-api` procedure in `.claude/skills/`.

## Consuming

```go
import "github.com/codefly-dev/saas-sdk-go/accounts"
```

Every message a facade method takes or returns, and everything reachable
through it, is re-exported by the facade package; a consumer never imports
`gen/`.


### Exact executable artifact consent

`moduleauthority.Client` exposes `ApproveExecutableArtifact`,
`AuthorizeExecutableArtifact`, and `RevokeExecutableArtifact` on the resolved
accounts authority endpoint, using the ordinary cached module credential plus
an independently signed human parent. The first is an explicit administrator
activation action; the second only checks existing exact consent. Never approve
as a fallback on a refused run. Neither operation dispatches work or moves an
active pointer.

`ArtifactRequest` names the installation, installed policy ID and
`ArtifactIdentity`: its schema, source, complete canonical subject bytes,
ordered exact contract references and an int64 expected revision. The host
validates its installed `MODULE_PRINCIPALS[<module>].artifact_policies` ceiling.
The SDK preserves subject bytes and int64 values exactly, bounds the request,
and refuses mismatched or malformed authorization receipts. The module owns
canonical identity extraction, including every script/runtime and content pin;
the host does not interpret configuration or fabricate publisher attestation.

Consent belongs to the tenant and survives administrator turnover. The host
rechecks current caller authority, installation, source, policy and explicit
revocation on each run. Revocation addresses the approval UUID from the returned
`host/approved-artifacts/<uuid>` Ref, even if the policy was disabled. Revoked
exact identities are terminal; a newly selected content version or activation
revision needs explicit new consent. These Refs are not tool or artifact-access
credentials.

### Current installation identity

`moduleauthority.Client.GetCurrentInstallation(ctx, CurrentInstallationRequest)`
reads the host's current active, non-revoked installation identity. Supply the
original verified parent token and `InstallationID`. The client presents its own
module Work Context independently on the resolved authority endpoint. It never
forwards a viewer bearer, selects a tenant/source, or mints broader parent scopes.

The result is `CurrentInstallation{InstallationID, TenantID, TargetID, BindingID}`.
The SDK requires the exact requested ID, valid tenant/target UUIDs and a
nonempty binding identity. This replaces the removed `SolutionIdentifier`
field: the host returns the immutable target and its delivered binding,
rather than a reusable route alias. The consumer must compare `TenantID`
to its independently verified request tenant and use the target/binding
identities for authority decisions. A successful observation is not executable
consent, a grant or durable liveness proof. Re-read for each new request.

The host preserves its organization-member metadata-read rule: no new permission
or binding is required. It checks current parent authority and delegation,
authenticated module/audience/tenant alignment, current membership, and exact
active record identity. A refusal never invokes a bearer-based fallback.

### Verifying a Work Context presented to you, at full strength

A module that RECEIVES a Work Context is its callee, and a callee verifies with
`sdk-go/workcontext`'s `PinnedVerifier` — core's verifier, with its
configuration settled. That verifier needs three live sources only the issuer
holds, and this SDK is how you reach them:

```go
sources, err := client.WorkContextSources(moduleauthority.WorkContextSourceSettings{
    Capability: presented, // the capability this module is verifying
})
// Handle err before using sources.
verifier, err := workcontext.NewVerifier(workcontext.VerifierSettings{
    Issuer: issuer, Audience: audience,
    Seals: sources, Revisions: sources, Grants: sources,
    Replay: replayStore, // yours, and durable+shared across replicas
}, keySet)
```

Without them a module can only run core's forwarding-hop `Inspector`, which
checks the encoding, signature, issuer, audience, window and shape and nothing
live — so a capability whose installation was revoked, whose operation binding
was withdrawn or whose principal's epoch has moved stays accepted until it
expires. A change of approved builds revokes through the principal's epoch and
the installation's revision; core's verifier asks for no build.

The capability is the only required setting, and it is the whole authorization:
the host authenticates it, requires it to be addressed to your module (its
registration prefix, or the route alias its delivered presence declares) and to
the organization your credential is bound to, and answers only about the
identifiers it names. There is no tenant, audience or owner to supply. Build one
per presented capability; a module verifying a stream of messages that carry the
same capability keeps one.

What the answers mean:

- `corework.ErrNoSeal` and `ErrNoBinding` are core's own sentinels, which its verifier turns into a refusal of the capability.
- `ErrUnreadableAuthorityAnswer` is a host answer this client will not read — a
  state it does not understand, another arm, or an answer about another
  principal, installation or binding. It is a refusal, never a permissive
  default.
- `ErrNoApprovalGrant` is an approval the issuer never recorded.
- A host refusal arrives with its **connect** code (`connect.CodeOf`):
  `CodeFailedPrecondition` means the issuer decided and the authority has
  changed — mint again, do not retry — while `CodeUnavailable` means the lookup
  failed and a retry may succeed.

Positive answers are cached for at most `AuthorityCacheBound` (2 seconds), which
is a **ceiling**: a cached answer delays a revocation by exactly its bound, so a
larger one is refused rather than clamped, and `CacheEntries: -1` turns caching
off. Refusals are never cached. One verification costs four or more round trips
(the revision, the seal, an epoch for the owner and for each actor hop, a
binding), so decide the cadence for a stream deliberately rather than
discovering it from a latency graph.

This module verifies nothing: it holds no key, reads no signature and decides
nothing about a capability. The decision is core's, through
`sdk-go/workcontext`.

### Gateway authority transport and audit declarations

`moduleauthority.NewGatewayAuthority(seams, credentials)` explicitly selects
the host's binary-protobuf Connect authority bridge at
`<gateway BaseURL>/modules/_authority`. Leave `Seams.Authority` zero when using
this constructor. It refuses any simultaneous direct Authority configuration,
applies the same credential and TLS/mesh checks as `New`, blocks redirects,
and does not fall back to Accounts. The selected host must serve this bridge;
a generated client alone
does not establish that a deployed host supports it or any particular procedure.
The existing `New` constructor retains the direct authority transport and its
mint-only mode. Audit declarations work with the existing direct authority
endpoint; they do not require the gateway bridge.

`Client.DeclareAuditEventTypes` presents the module's event schemas through the
selected authority seam. Ownership and compatibility remain host decisions.
Public declaration types and enum constants are re-exported by moduleauthority.
The SDK supplies `Credentials.Prefix`, uses the same cached module Work Context
as other authority calls, and preserves every field, enum value, visibility and
PII flag. It does not create a second registry or infer a namespace from a prefix.

After constructing `authority` with the resolved seams and projected credentials
as above, declare schemas during startup and propagate any refusal:

```go
err = authority.DeclareAuditEventTypes(ctx, []*moduleauthority.ModuleAuditEventTypeDeclaration{
    {
        Type:        "example.item.changed", // namespace bound to this module by the operator
        Description: "An item changed",
        Visibility:  moduleauthority.ModuleAuditEventVisibility_MODULE_AUDIT_EVENT_VISIBILITY_TENANT,
        Fields: []*moduleauthority.ModuleAuditFieldDeclaration{
            {Name: "item_id", Kind: moduleauthority.ModuleAuditFieldKind_MODULE_AUDIT_FIELD_KIND_UUID},
            {Name: "contact", Kind: moduleauthority.ModuleAuditFieldKind_MODULE_AUDIT_FIELD_KIND_STRING, Pii: true},
        },
    },
})
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```

The host admits only operator-bound namespaces. Re-declaring the identical schema
is idempotent; fields and enum values may grow, while removal, retyping and changes
to visibility are refused. A rejected module capability (`Unauthenticated`) is
refreshed and retried once. Other authority refusals retain their Connect codes
and details (`connect.CodeOf(err)` / `errors.As`) and are not retried. A mint-only
client's declaration fails with `ErrNoAuthority` before any network request. A
missing bridge fails without switching transports.

Broker non-200 responses return `*moduleauthority.BrokerError`, discoverable
with `errors.As`. It contains only `StatusCode` and `Classification`
(`BrokerErrorRefused` for 401/403, `BrokerErrorNotEstablished` for 503,
`BrokerErrorOther` otherwise), with a fixed message per class. Response bodies
and headers are excluded entirely; classification never depends on reading a
body. The 401, 403 and 503 sentinels remain `ErrInvalidCredentials`,
`ErrPermissionDenied` (or `ErrDelegationInvalid` for source mints), and
`ErrExecutionUnestablished`. A source mint's 412 is `ErrDelegationMissing`: the
source has no active delegation to this module, and a person must connect or
reconnect it — minting again will not help. The gateway answers 412 there only
for a missing delegation, so the status alone decides it. Body-based delegation
distinctions are gone: source 403s all return `ErrDelegationInvalid`, whether
the delegation was revoked or is otherwise unusable.
A module work-context or operation-context mint answers 412 when the module is
proven and the host holds nothing to mint against — admitted but installed
nowhere among them. That is `ErrNoHostStateToMintFor`, never a delegation
sentinel; the module can serve its install endpoint while waiting.
`BrokerError.Path` and `BrokerError.Reason` have been removed.

Transport and response read failures return `*moduleauthority.BrokerTransportError`
with a fixed message and a `Category`: `BrokerTransportTimeout`,
`BrokerTransportConnectionRefused`, `BrokerTransportConnectionReset`,
`BrokerTransportTLS`, or `BrokerTransportOther`. It retains no underlying
error and has no `Unwrap` method. Callers use `errors.As` and the category for retry decisions, and check
their context's `Err()` for cancellation. For example, a caller may retry a 502,
503, timeout, refused connection or connection reset, while surfacing a 401/403
denial. The SDK does not automatically retry broker failures. Malformed initial
HTTP headers provide no usable status and produce a transport error; malformed bodies cannot
change a successfully parsed non-200 status into a transport failure.

### Journal client reuse

`moduleauthority.Client.ReadJournal` reuses this client's broker, module-credential
cache and refresh-once behavior, existing Accounts HTTP/2 transport, and journal
projection. The host protobuf constraints validate requests before credentials
are obtained. Invalid nonempty timestamps are refused before a page is returned.
No additional reader factory or credential-producer API is added.

Generic shared Authority `Issue` requires an operation binding and cannot mint
an unbound `module-capabilities` identity. A consumer must qualify its credential
route; transport tests alone do not establish producer compatibility.

| Build or reuse | Searched and verified | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Journal client | Existing Client module credentials, cache, callAsModule transport, protobuf request constraints and journal tests | Extend Client.ReadJournal. Remove the unqualified second reader factory; reuse the existing broker, cache and decoder instead of adding a credential API. |
